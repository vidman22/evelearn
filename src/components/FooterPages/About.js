            <h4>About Kwinzo</h4>
                <p>Kwinzo is a tool to be used in education by both teachers and students inside and outside the classroom.</p>
                <p>Kwinzo was created by a teacher for teachers and developed through hours of practical experience.</p>
                <p>Kwinzo hopes to create a positive classroom atmosphere for the students through calming, responsive user interfaces and fun interactive games.</p>
                <p>Kwinzo operates on the principle that when the teacher has invested in the lesson the students respond, and when the students are invested in the lesson the teacher's load is eased.</p>
                <p>Kwinzo is platform for learners and educators, a tool for those who want to create, and a resource for those who want to learn.</p>
                <p>Kwinzo hopes to assist in the reduction of teacher print-outs, as the online lesson can be distributed and accessed at any time on any browser.</p>
